# Spatial Transcriptomics Techonlogies

With Spatial Transcriptomics we refer to all thosetechnologies which are able to joint 
detect the transcripts quantification and their spatial coordinates into a reference tissue.


# The SpatialExperiment class




To facilitate the implementation of methodologies and the spatial data handling
in R, we designed a new class named `SpatialExperiment`.
This class inherits from the popular Bioconductor class `SingleCellExperiment`
and extend it with specific slots and get/set methods for spatial data.

Here is a schematics of the organization of the `SpatialExperiment` class.
