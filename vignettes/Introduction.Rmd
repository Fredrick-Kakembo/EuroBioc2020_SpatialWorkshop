# Spatial Transcriptomics Techonlogies

With Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) we refer to all thosetechnologies which are able to **joint** 
detect the **transcripts quantification** and their **spatial coordinates** into a reference tissue.

At the moment, we distinguish two main families of ST, *molecular-based* and 
*spot-based* technologies.

## Molecular-Based technologies

The main idea of this technologies is to detect the transcripts locations in 
a tissue in multiple temporal snapshots.

Examples of this family are: seqFISH(+), MERFISH, others 

Main differences within this family are due to the way of transcripts coordinates 
detection and most important on the number of detected trascripts.

### seqFISH(+)

seqFISH technology uses multiple temporal barcodes of transcripts hybridization rounds.
This allows to detect the localization of the transcripts at each barcoded time.

First version (seqFISH) of this technology allowed to detect undreads of transcripts,
while second version (seqFISH+) allows to detect thousands of transcripts at each round
which allows this technology to be comparable with a transcriptome 


# The SpatialExperiment class

To facilitate the implementation of methodologies and the spatial data handling
in R, we designed a new class named `SpatialExperiment`.
This class inherits from the popular Bioconductor class `SingleCellExperiment`
and extend it with specific slots and get/set methods for spatial data.

Here is a schematics of the organization of the `SpatialExperiment` class.
